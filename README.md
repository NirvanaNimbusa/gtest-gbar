# gtest-gbar
_This project is an independent addition for [googletest](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/)._

Google Test is an excellent xUnit style c++ unit testing framework. It is highly recommended. One (minor) drawback of Google Test is it's text based UI, and this project attempts to help.

Current Version: *1.2.3* [details](https://github.com/ospector/gtest-gbar/wiki/Version-History) 

The project is written in C# and runs on Windows and Linux. Window executable available for download. Linux executable can be easily built using Mono and Mono Develop - link to sources zip is at your right.
